            </p>
            <p className="md:text-lg">
                To be honest this is a tough question for me to answer because how am I able to describe a good gut feeling is to you over these 1 and 0s on the screen ?
                <br/>
                To start off with I want to join a software house. I asked my sister's husband who has been in the Software industry for over 20 years where to apply and he mentioned you guys as one of the best in the country up there with BBD and Entelect.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-center pb-5 italic md:text-xl text-lg">
                    Ugly website = Don't bother
                </p>
                Next I visited your website which is a very important step for me. I have my own litmus test to see whether or not a company is worth applying for and that is there website. 
                <br/>
                In the modern world there is no excuse to not have a website that does not have a modern look and modern UX especially if you are in the tech industry. I just have a gut intuition that an bland website correlates to creating below average software.
                <br/>
                Obviously you guys passed that litmus test with flying colours (duh) because your website feels so welcoming and enjoying to browse through. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <p className="text-center pb-5 italic md:text-xl text-lg">
                    Give me space to excel and we can excel together
                </p>
                Next I looked at your core values as a company and I really resonated with them. In 2021 I was team leader for my final year project in my Software Development module and all of your core 'spexs' were the exact same as mine. I am also a big believer in communication being the number one key to success with anything in life especially if it is a partnership or working in a team. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I want to work with a company that is up to date with the latest technologies and allows there employees to be exposed to said technologies. The last thing I want to waste my talents on is an old UNIX banking system that has not been updated in years because of the reasoning of "if it ain't broke then don't fix it."
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I want to work with a company that works with different projects from different industries. This will not only adapt but also enhance my skills and understanding of how technology can be incorporated into every industry.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Lastly I want to work with people that appreciate the combination of creative artistic expression with the efficiency, robustness and modularity of the best coding and deployment practices.  
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Also my favorite colour is blue so I guess that is just the cherry on top.
